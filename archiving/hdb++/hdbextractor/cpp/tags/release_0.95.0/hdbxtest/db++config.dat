# The FillFromThePastMode configures how the lack of data in the desired time window is managed.
# Possible values (if not specified, the default is None):
#
# None:        nothing is done if the window does not contain data or if valid data starts late.
# KeepWindow:  look in the past for the most recent valid data and make it the first value of the window.
#              The timestamp is changed to start the date/time  of the time window.
# WidenWindow: look in the past for the most recent valid data and put it in as the first result with its
#              preserving its original timestamp.
#
FillFromThePastMode = WidenWindow

# The FillFromThePastThresholdPercent instructs the extractor to look in the past for the most recent
# valid value, if FillFromThePastMode is not set to None.
# The value is a floating point number representing the percentage of the whole time interval that the
# first data in the desired must fall in so that fill from the past is unnecessary.
# For example, suppose you requested a time interval of 10 hours, i.e. tend - start = 10hours.
# Then, if FillFromThePastThresholdPercent is 10.0 and the first valid data occurs within the first hour,
# no need to fill from the past. Otherwise FillFromThePastMode determines how the the first value is
# brought into the data set at the beginning of the window.
# Default: 5%
#
FillFromThePastThresholdPercent = 5
